\subsection*{1.1 The Stenopaic Spectacles}
In this lab we were instructed to look out of a lens with a bunch of holes. We were able to observe, after looking into the glasses, a slight dim in brightness. It was easy to see small print writing. I could see the writing on my journal in a sort of zoom in. The writing was tiny before the glasses, however after the width was noticeably bigger.
