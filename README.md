# Random Research
A research in pure mathematics

Above you might think you see a bunch of random files. You are right! Above is the first approach I took for research in Number Theory. Although disorganized there are some PDFs that show the progress I made. I don't expect to get published as I did it all for fun. Along the way I created many programs to run for solutions. Instead of deleting these files I decided to keep them open to whoever might be able to use them, and as a place to store additional files for the additional research I might eventually end up doing.
